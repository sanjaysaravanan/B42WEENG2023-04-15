Topics:

  formik:
    external package for handling form, actions, values, validations

      1. values for the form -> initialValues
      2. Change of the values in the form --> handleChange
      3. submit of the form -> onSubmit, handleSubmit
      4. validationSchema using yup third party package
      5. onBlur --> formik.handleBlur to take care of touched
      6. use the errors along with touched object
      7. conditionally show the errors using point no 6

  api ->

  fetch vs axios

    fetch is inbuilt js api to handle external api calls
    involves simple xmlhttprequest which needs the header to be specified and response to handle using json

    axios is third party open source package in npm
      simpler codes provided as module/funcs
      which hides few operation like json of response and specification of header

  axios:
    similar to fetch and does the things in bit simpler than fetch api

    axios --> a separate package to external api requests
      which is simpler few lines of code
      avoid the need of .json()

    axios --> instance, interceptors
  
  monolith appliction ( https://amazon.in entire application ( Lisint Products, Cart, Account ) in on single url/instance )
  
  microservices ( modules are separated ( cart (https://amz-cart.in), Account (https://amz-account.in) ) )

  axios instances lets us creating multiple for multiple services ( restcount, openweather )

  interceptors:
    axios lets us a way to intercept the request/response as well the response
